## Grants & Key Projects

<div class="card">
  <strong>IG250200014 — SafeBuild AI: Intelligent Safety and Efficiency for Construction SMEs (2026–2027)</strong><br/>
  <span class="small">Role: Lead Chief Investigator (Lead CI) · Funding: AEA Ignite Round 2 · Amount: $549,886 (AEA $474,886 + Industry $75,000)</span>
  <p>
    This project aims to develop an AI-powered safety assurance platform to reduce incidents and ease administrative burdens in Australian construction.
    We will create a lightweight, domain-specific LLM with <em>construction-savvy reasoning</em> using partner data.
    The key deliverable is a <strong>TRL 5 Proactive Safety Assurance Module</strong>, validated in the partner’s environment, that automates SWMS compliance auditing and generates dynamic safety checklists.
    Advancing the technology from TRL 3 to TRL 5 provides a clear commercialisation pathway for construction SMEs.

  <strong>IG240100414 — Intelligent FCAS Agent for Renewable Energy Power Systems (2025–2026)</strong><br/>
  <span class="small">Role: Chief Investigator (CI) (Lead: Dr. Yanming Zhu, Griffith University) · Funding: AEA Ignite Round 1 · Amount: $508,442 (AEA $429,720 + Industry $78,722)</span>
  <p>
    The goal is to analyse grid data and predict grid frequency fluctuations to optimise power dispatch and battery storage in solar power systems, enabling efficient intelligent energy management.
    This reduces power supply costs and enhances the stability and efficiency of the national grid.
    Building on the team’s TRL 3 techniques, the project targets a semi-integrated system and aims to reach <strong>TRL 5</strong> to support commercialisation.
