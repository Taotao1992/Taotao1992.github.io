## Grants & Key Projects

<div class="card">
  <strong>IG250200014 — SafeBuild AI: Intelligent Safety and Efficiency for Construction SMEs (2026–2027)</strong><br/>
  <span class="small">Role: Lead Chief Investigator (Lead CI) · Funding: AEA Ignite Round 2 · Amount: $549,886 (AEA $474,886 + Industry $75,000)</span>
  <p>
    This project aims to develop an AI-powered safety assurance platform to reduce incidents and ease administrative burdens in Australian construction.
    We will create a lightweight, domain-specific LLM with <em>construction-savvy reasoning</em> using partner data.
    The key deliverable is a <strong>TRL 5 Proactive Safety Assurance Module</strong>, validated in the partner’s environment, that automates SWMS compliance auditing and generates dynamic safety checklists.
    Advancing the technology from TRL 3 to TRL 5 provides a clear commercialisation pathway for construction SMEs.

  <div class="small">
    <strong>High-Impact Recognition:</strong> Selected as the featured project for Queensland in the Australian Government’s official announcement (one key initiative per state). The release specifically highlighted this project’s capacity “to improve construction safety using AI compliance detection.”

  <strong>IG240100414 — Intelligent FCAS Agent for Renewable Energy Power Systems (2025–2026)</strong><br/>
  <span class="small">Role: Chief Investigator (CI) (Lead: Dr. Yanming Zhu, Griffith University) · Funding: AEA Ignite Round 1 · Amount: $508,442 (AEA $429,720 + Industry $78,722)</span>
  <p>
    The goal is to analyse grid data and predict grid frequency fluctuations to optimise power dispatch and battery storage in solar power systems, enabling efficient intelligent energy management.
    This reduces power supply costs and enhances the stability and efficiency of the national grid.
    Building on the team’s TRL 3 techniques, the project targets a semi-integrated system and aims to reach <strong>TRL 5</strong> to support commercialisation.

## News (recent)

<ul class="news">
  <li><strong>[01/2026]</strong> Exciting news to share ✨: Our AEA Ignite 2025 Round 2 project (Lead CI, IG250200014) has now been officially announced as funded! (We were actually notified by the Research Office in late December 2025, but it remained under embargo until now.) Combined with an AEA 2025 Round 1 project led by my brilliant colleague (which I’m part of), my “nominal” total funding footprint for 2025 — yes, mostly for bragging rights 😜 — has officially crossed the AUD $1M mark 🎢 Details for this round: 💰 AUD $474,886 (Grant) + AUD $75K (Industry Cash)
  <br/>A massive thank you to our industry partners for their unwavering support, and a huge shout-out to collaborators from Griffith University, The University of Adelaide, and UniSQ.</li>
  <li><strong>[08/2025]</strong> Our paper, “Community-Diversified Influence Maximization in Social Networks”, has been selected by the Information Systems Journal as one of the most influential papers of the past decade ([URL](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/10CG3RPRFTG)). This recognition is part of the journal’s 50th Anniversary Virtual Special Issue, celebrating milestone contributions to the field. Information Systems is a highly regarded Core - A* journal in the field of data science.</li>
  <li><strong>[08/2025]</strong> 😋 Congratulations to Han Li on successfully forming his Nascent Soul. — From the anime A Record of a Mortal’s Journey to Immortality 😋</li>
  <li><strong>[05/2025]</strong> Congratulations to Penghui! His paper, “LG-Umer: A UNet-like Network Integrating Local-Global Features with a Novel Attention Mechanism for Road Extraction from Remote Sensing Images,” has been accepted by the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (SCI Q1). Penghui’s dedication and hard work are truly admirable. Best of luck with the third and final manuscripts now in progress. 🍀Those who devote themselves wholeheartedly to their work will one day walk a path awash in blossom and fragrance with blossoms.💐</li>
  <li><strong>[03/2025]</strong> I am thrilled to share that our team has secured a $429,720 Australia's Economic Accelerator (AEA) – Ignite Grant (IG240100414) from the Department of Education, Australia.
